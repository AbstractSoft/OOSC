Object-Oriented Software Construction

This repository contains sample code for the Object-Oriented Software Construction course.

The Abstraction sample is inspired by https://github.com/thjanssen/Stackify-OopAbstraction

Modern coffee machines have become pretty complex. Depending on the users’ choice of coffee, they’ll use the right amount of water and heat it to the required temperature to brew a huge cup of filter coffee or a small and strong espresso. Using the concept of Abstraction, we can hide all decisions and processing steps within the CoffeeMachine class.
